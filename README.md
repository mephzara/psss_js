# psss_js - Particle System Screen Saver Engine Ported to Javascript

For a running demo visit [Particle Systems Screen Saver Engine Demo](http://mephzara.com/misc/psss_js/)

The particle system screen saver was originally developed nearly 25 years ago. I wrote it in Delphi (Object Pascal) and assembler. At the time, I was delving into graphics code, filters, and 3D. Graphics cards, like the 3dfx Voodoo 3D accelerators, were still in their infancy and not a standard feature in PCs. I worked primarily with custom graphics programming and turned to assembler when I aimed to maximize the performance of my CPU.

The culmination of these experiments was a screen saver that gained significant recognition. After uploading it to a 3dfx shareware site, it amassed over 50,000 downloads on its first night. Subsequently, I made it available on platforms like Tucows, CNET, Download.com, and many others. It received reviews in magazines and garnered positive ratings and feedback. Offered as shareware, some of my users even composed music for it, sharing their tracks with me. A notable highlight was my participation in the Liquid Sound Festival in Jena. There, the animations were tailored to sync with compositions by Jan Zehn and showcased at the Zeiss-Planetarium Jena.

Now, after more than two decades, I'm releasing the code for this software as open source. I've ported it to JavaScript, and with the rapid advancements in today's technology, modern browsers can smoothly render the animations in JavaScript.

Enjoy! Best regards,

## How does it work? What does it do?

The animations utilize 3D particles that move along amplitude and frequency-modulated sine waves across all spatial axes, reminiscent of 3D Lissajous curves. By combining multiple waves with varied amplitudes, frequencies, phases, and modulation parameters, an infinite array of variations can be achieved. Colors are generated by waves that oscillate within the RGB color space.

The resulting animation is then projected and rendered in 2D. Some presets incorporate a filter I've termed the "translation map." This filter relocates each 2D pixel to a new position, determined by the sum of multiple waves along the X and Y axes, producing fractal-like movements within the image. Lastly, a brightness decay and a blur filter can be applied to gradually fade pixels over time and soften the overall image. These final filters are now processed by the graphics functions of the browser and the underlying hardware.
